The company’s intended customer is smaller, new retail traders who are looking to begin investing in the stock market.

## Landscape:

Equity Trading

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?

Mobile Platform trading and some brokerages have started offering API libraries for automated trading. 

* What are the other major companies in this domain?

Etrade, Charles Schwab, Fidelity, Interactive Brokers, TD Ameritrade


## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?

Has taken some of the business of the brokerages that were established and around for a lot longer as well as has gotten many new participants into the market that had never traded before.

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?

Success is measured both by the number of users using the platform and the profit made off of them although in Robinhood’s case they primarily make money through other means like offering premium services like Robinhood Gold, making interest off of the accounts, and payment for order flow through market making companies such as Citadel securities and Two Sigma.  


* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?

It is performing well in comparison to the other competitors in the same domain. It has almost an identical current valuation to publicly traded E*TRADE and has the highest new user growth among any of the brokerages.

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)

I would actually recommend Robinhood to offer the option to pay for commission but not longer have the payment for order flow which is a controversial aspect of the brokerage. 

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

It would add more flexibility to the platform while maintain its staple of having the option to have all of your trades executed on zero commission. 

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

Nothing over what is already currently used in Robinhood would likely take some talented coders to make the interface simple while also allowing those who want to stay completely commission free the ability to keep the current platform with minimal or no changes. 



* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?

There’s not really any additional technologies that are needed for this solution.
